You may think of the British class system as an amusing anecdote and a thing of the past; something you smile indulgently at when you see memes on the internet, or watch classic British sketch shows. But if anything, this crisis has shown us that it's still very much alive, and was until now just simmering just under the thin veneer of respectability of Westminster.

The seeds of this crisis were sown in the troubled times of the 70s and 80s. These were the dark days of the IRA, and seemingly endless turmoil between the government and the trade unions. Since the 1700s, the central and north of England had been at the centre of the industrial world, for better or worse; first driving the industrial revolution and then the expansion of the British empire, and then providing the manufacturing power that kept the country fighting during two world wars, through the coal and steel industries, and the mighty dockyards of Liverpool, Newcastle, and others.
This industrial pre-eminence was brought crashing down however, most famously and finally during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher and previous and successive Tory governments. The dockyards had already been in decline, and the troubled climate of post-war Europe saw the last close completely. The steel mills, knitwear factories and coal mines were still huge employers however, but their death knell came, and after Thatcher famously smashed the unions in the strikes of the 80s, pit after pit closed until there were none left.

The mass unemployment that was the result of this, in Wales and the north of England especially, cannot be understated. Coal mines were often the sole employers for entire regions, and with all the jobs gone and nothing to replace them, so too did entire towns disappear as the inhabitants were forced to move on to find work, gravitating to cities such as Hull and Sunderland.

Concentration of the population in urban centres did not solve the problem, by any means. With high levels of unemployment, and low levels of education and opportunities, a large proportion of the north of England have felt marginalised and ignored by the elite of Westminster for three decades. These regions have been limping by for an entire disaffected generation, barely surviving on EU funding and the occasional handout from the government. The rise of neoliberalism and the benefits of globalisation have bypassed these towns and cities, and the endemic lack of investment, or even acknowledgement or care, has resulted in a large proportion of the population feeling that they have no voice, no-one to represent them, and no power or even influence over their own situation.

So now, a politician comes along and says, "I can give you a sense of worth and restore the health service", and certain national media outlets inflame the situation by pointing at hordes of immigrants arriving (whether real or perceived), who must either be claiming benefits, or working in jobs that don't seem to be there for natives.

It begs the question: can you really blame them for jumping at the chance to finally have a say in their own futures?"
